Sure! Here's a clean, human-readable `README.md` for your Flask + React + Docker project:

# PerfectCup ☕  
A Full-Stack Flask + React App, Dockerized for Easy Development and Deployment

---

## 🧩 Overview

**PerfectCup** is a full-stack web application built with a React frontend and a Flask backend. It uses Docker to make development and deployment smooth and consistent across environments.

- 🖥️ Frontend: React (served via Flask)
- 🐍 Backend: Flask (Python)
- 🐳 Docker: For containerized development
- 📦 Folder structure: Clean separation of frontend and backend

## 🚀 How to Run the App (Dockerized)

### 1. Build React frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
````

This creates a production-ready React build in `frontend/build`.

---

### 2. Build Flask backend (which serves the frontend too)

```bash
cd ../backend
docker build -t my-flask-backend .
```

---

### 3. Run the container

```bash
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 my-flask-backend
```

Open your browser and go to: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

---

## 🛠️ Development Tips

* Make changes in `frontend/src/` then run `npm run build` again to update.
* Flask backend changes don’t require rebuild unless you change dependencies.
* Use Docker volumes and ports for advanced development setups (optional).

## 🙋‍♂️ Why Docker?

Docker ensures the app runs the same everywhere — whether on your machine, a server, or the cloud. No more "it works on my machine" issues.
